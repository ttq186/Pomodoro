## Description
- Pomodoro is a famous time management technique that helps us boost our productivity. It uses a timer to break work into sessions (typically 25mins) separated by short breaks (typically 5mins). After 4 consecutive sessions, we will take a long break (typically 20mins) and start over until our target task is finished.
- In the past, I applied this technique a lot at [Pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io) and it's helped to boost my productivity a lot. This is a great Pomodoro app with beautiful UI and many handy features. One day, I decided to create a Pomorodo app of my own. It is the reason why this project was created.
